"Vikram Bhandari
relation de 2e niveau
2e","Fremont, Californie, États-Unis","Starting as a technology enthusiast back in the 1990s, I worked for enterprises in different verticals. With those experiences, I found the “hiccup” in entrepreneurship, or what I call the “infectious entrepreneurial bug,” compelling me to provide strategic consulting to improve management and operations for several businesses.

The year 2003 marked the first milestone in my entrepreneurial journey when I joined a technology company helping businesses to achieve digital transformation. In just four years of its existence, the company expanded to 400 members. The achievement fostered my belief that people are the most significant asset for any technology consulting company. I began building my team, not just high on numbers but also on expertise and business acumen, and founded Yantra six years later in 2009.

Yantra was formed to offer business value that goes beyond solutions, services, and technical advice. I built the company’s foundation based on the philosophy of an entrepreneur at heart: The true gains of business transformation cannot be unlocked by those who merely sell technology, but by those who understand the nuances of business and offer solutions that enable visible, measurable, and progressive value. Technology with purpose and a drive to deliver with passion has helped me empower organizations

Besides Yantra, I have also founded and nurtured several other ventures and successfully built global consulting companies from the ground-up in Silicon Valley, Candana, India, and the Philippines to keep my passion and entrepreneurship journey going
